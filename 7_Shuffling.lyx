Hypotheses and errors

\begin_layout Subsection
Null and alternative hypotheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In elementary school most students are taught the scientific method follows
 the following steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Ask a question of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Construct a hypothesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Design and conduct an experiment that challenges the hypothesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Depending on how consistent the data is with the hypothesis:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
If the observed data is inconsistent with the hypothesis, then we have proven
 it wrong and we should consider competing hypotheses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the observed data is consistent with the hypothesis, design a more rigorous
 experiment to continue testing the hypothesis.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Through the iterative process of testing ideas and refining them under the
 ever growing body of evidence, we continually improve our understanding
 of how our universe works.
 The heart of the scientific method is the falsification of hypothesis and
 statistics is the tool we'll use to assess the consistency of our data
 with a hypothesis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Science is done by examining competing ideas for how the world works and
 throwing evidence at them.
 Each time a hypothesis is removed, the remaining hypotheses appear to be
 more credible.
 This doesn't mean the remaining hypotheses are correct, only that they
 are consistent with the available data.

In approximately 300 BC, Eratosthenes

 by measuring the different lengths of shadows of identical sticks in two
 cities that were 580 miles apart but lay on the same meridian (Alexandria
 is directly north of Aswan).
 His proposed alternative was that the Earth was a sphere.
 While his alternative is not technically true (it is actually an oblate
 spheroid that bulges at the equator), it was substantially better than
 the flat world hypothesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At one point it was believed that plants 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the soil and turned it into plant mass.
 A experiment to test this hypothesis was performed by Johannes Baptista
 van Helmont in 1648 in which he put exactly 200 pounds of soil in a pot
 and then grew a willow tree out of it for five years.
 At the end of the experiment, the pot contained 199.875 pounds of soil and
 168 pounds of willow tree.
 He correctly concluded that the plant matter was not substantially taken
 from the soil but incorrectly jumped to the conclusion that the mass must
 of have come from the water that was used to irrigate the willow.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is helpful to our understanding to label the different hypothesis, both
 the ones being tested and the different alternatives.
 We'll label the hypothesis being tested as 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}$
\end_inset

 which we often refer to as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\series bold
null hypothesis
\series default
.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The 
\series bold
alternative hypothesis
\series default
, which we'll denote 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{a}$
\end_inset

, should be the opposite of the null hypothesis.
 Had Eratosthenes known about modern scientific methods, he would have correctly
 considered 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}:$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
the world is flat
\emph default
 verses 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{a}$
\end_inset

: 
\emph on
the world is not flat
\emph default
 and not incorrectly concluded that the world is a sphere
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Amusingly Eratosthenes' data wasn't inconsistent with the hypothesis that
 the world was shaped like a donut, but he thought the sphere to be more
 likely.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Likewise Helmont should have considered the hypotheses 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}:$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
plants only consume soil
\emph default
 versus the alternative 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{a}:$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
plants consume something besides soil
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In both of cases, the observed data was compared to what would have been
 expected if the null hypothesis was true.
 If the null was true Eratosthenes would have seen the same length shadow
 in both cities and Helmont would have seen 168 pounds of willow tree and
 
\begin_inset Formula $200-168=32$
\end_inset

 pounds of soil remaining.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Error
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately the world is not a simple place and experiments rarely can
 isolate exactly the hypothesis being tested.
 We can repeat an experiment and get slightly different results each time
 due to variation in weather, temperature, or diligence of the researcher.
 If we are testing the effectiveness of a new drug to treat a particular
 disease, we don't trust the results of a single patient, instead we wish
 to examine many patients (some that receive the new drug and some the receive
 the old) to average out the noise between the patients.
 The questions about how many patients do we need to have and how large
 of a difference between the treatments is large enough to conclude the
 new drug is better are the heart of modern statistics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose we consider the population of all US men aged 40-60 with high blood
 pressure (there might be about 20 million people in this population).
 We want to know if exercise and ACE inhibitors lower systolic blood pressure
 better than exercise alone for these people.
 We'll consider the null hypothesis that 
\emph on
exercise is equivalent to exercise and ACE inhibitors
\emph default
 versus 
\emph on
exercise is different than exercise and ACE inhibitors.

\emph default
 If we could take every single member of the population and expose them
 to exercise or exercise with ACE inhibitors, we would know for certain
 how the population reacts to the different treatments.
 Unfortunately this is too expensive and ethically dubious.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of testing the entire population we'll take a sample of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 men from the population and treat half of them with exercise alone and
 half of them with exercise and ACE inhibitors.
 What might our data look like if there is a difference between the two
 treatments at different samples sizes compared to if there is no difference?
 At small sample sizes it is difficult to distinguish the effect of the
 treatment when it is masked by individual variation.
 At high sample sizes, the individual variation is smoothed out and the
 difference between the treatments can be readily seen.

When the sample size is large it is easy to see if the treatments differ
 in their effect on systolic blood pressure, but at medium or small sample
 sizes, the question is much harder.
 It is important to recognize that the core of the problem is still 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld

is the observed data consistent with the null hypothesis?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\emph default
but we now have to consider an addition variability term that is unrelated
 to the research hypothesis of interest.
 In the above example, the small sample data is consistent with the null
 hypothesis even when the null hypothesis is false!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To clarify this idea, it is useful to clarify our notation to distinguish
 between the population parameters (numbers the describe the population)
 versus the sample statistics (numbers that describe the sample).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Population Parameters - These quantities will be denoted with Greek letters
 such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 for means, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 for proportions, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 for variances.
 These are the quantities that we are interested in, but do not know the
 actual values (unless we perform a complete census on the population).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sample Statistics - These are the quantities that are calculated from the
 sample and will be denoted with Roman letters, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}$
\end_inset

 for means, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 for proportions, 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{2}$
\end_inset

 for variances.
 We only care about these values in the sense that they are proxies for
 the population parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a sample to be representative of the population, we want it to be selected
 in a manner that avoid bias.
 For example, a political phone survey should avoid just calling retired
 (and generally more conservative) individuals but try to sample both young
 and old people in roughly the same percentage as in the population.
 If we are performing a study on 50-60 year old males with heart disease,
 we should strive to get an ethnic diversity that reflects the population,
 or recognize the sample is actually representative of a particular subpopulatio
n.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Sampling distribution of a proportion 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to conclude the null hypothesis is incorrect, we must compare the
 data we observed to what we could have seen if the null hypothesis was
 correct.
 Just as Eratosthenes expected to see equal length shadows if the earth
 was flat, we need to consider what data we could have observed if the null
 hypothesis was correct.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To assess if the our data is consistent with the null hypothesis, it is
 useful to reduce the observed data into a summary statistic that is related
 to the hypothesis of interest.
 Sometimes the summary statistic is obvious, but sometimes not.
 We then will compare the observed sample statistic to the distribution
 of statistic values that we could have seen.
 We will call this distribution of possible sample statistics (assuming
 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}$
\end_inset

 is true) the sampling distribution of the statistic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several different methods we'll use to produce the sampling distributi
on and are often specific to a particular to the design of the study but
 the goal of producing possible realizations of the statistic that are consisten
t with the null hypothesis and the study design will be a constant theme.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}:\,\pi=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will first consider the case where we wish to test the null hypothesis
 that some proportion is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The method will then be slightly modified to address testing for proportions
 other than 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the human sex ratio tends to be very close to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 female and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 male, this isn't necessarily true for the gender

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Broadly categorizing sex and gender (they are different!) into just Male/Female

 ratio of graduate students.
 It is reasonable to suppose a null and alternative hypotheses of
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
H_{0}: & \pi=\frac{1}{2}\\
H_{a}: & \pi\ne\frac{1}{2}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 represents the true proportion of graduate students that are female.
 In our class (Spring 2015) the proportion of females is 
\begin_inset Formula $p=\frac{16}{38}\approx0.421$
\end_inset

.
 If we consider this class as a sample of NAU grad students (a dubious assumptio
n), is our observed data consistent with the null hypothesis? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What set of values should we expect to see if the probability that any randomly
 selected student is female is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

? In later chapters we'll use the rules of probability answer the question,
 but for now we'll turn to simulation.
 We could use fair coins and have every student flip a coin separately and
 count the number of heads, and denote the proportion of heads as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 We can repeat this procedure 10 times and graph the observed proportions

 Is the experimental data consistent with the null hypothesis of

 be evidence against the null hypothesis as would an experiment where we
 saw too many.

 These two types of research differ in the way that the researcher interacts

 In contrast, in an experiment, the researcher imposes different treatments

 happens at random.

 (E+P) was stopped on July 7, 2002 (after an average 5.6 years of follow-up)
 because of increased risks of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer
 in women taking active study pills, compared with those on placebo (inactive
 pills).
 The study showed that the overall risks exceeded the benefits, with women
 taking E+P at higher risk for heart disease, blood clots, stroke, and breast
 cancer, but at lower risk for fracture and colon cancer.
 Lurking variables such as income levels and education are correlated to
 overall health behaviors and with an increased use of hormone replacement
 therapy.
 By randomly assigning each woman to a treatment, the unidentified lurking
 variables were evenly spread across treatments and the dangers of hormone
 replacement therapy were revealed.

There is a fundamental difference between imposing treatments onto subjects
 versus taking a random sample from a population and observing relationships
 between variables.
 In general, designed experiments allow us to determine cause-and-effect
 relationships while observational studies can only determine if variables
 are correlated.
 This difference in how the data is generated will result in different methods
 for generating a sampling distribution for a statistic of interest.
 In this chapter we will focus on experimental designs.

\begin_layout Subsection
Two groups, continuous response variable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often researchers will obtain a group of subjects and them into two groups,
 provide different treatments to each, and the observe some response.
 The goal is to see if the two groups are different in some fashion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first thing to consider is that the group of subjects in our sample
 is should be representative of a population of interest.
 Because we cannot impose an experiment on an entire population, we often
 are forced to examine a small sample and we hope that the sample statistics
 (the sample mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}$
\end_inset

, and sample standard deviation 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

) are good estimates of the population parameters (the population mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

, and population standard deviation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

) First recognize that these are a sample and we generally think of them
 to be representative of some population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, the way that the two groups are different could be if the mean of
 group 1 is greater than the mean of the other.
 This is the most common difference to be interested in and we are usually
 interested in the difference between the mean responses.
 There is nothing to say that we couldn't look at the difference in variance,
 using the same method we'll cover next.

 the population of male college-aged students so the hypotheses we are intereste

If the null hypothesis is true, then the caffeinated/non-caffeinated group

 In this case we want an alternative of

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
H_{0}:\,\mu_{nc}-\mu_{c} & \ge & 0\\
H_{a}:\,\mu_{nc}-\mu_{c} & < & 0

 the null and alternative are 
\begin_inset Formula

The creation of the sampling distribution of the mean difference 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{*}$

 is identical to our previous technique because if our observed difference
 
\begin_inset Formula $d$

 is so negative that it is incompatible with the hypothesis that 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=0$
\end_inset

 then it 
\emph on
must

 also be incompatible with any positive value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$

\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 that is closest to the observed 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 while still being true to the null hypothesis.
 Thus for either the the one-sided (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta<0$
\end_inset

) or the two-sided case (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\ne0$
\end_inset

), we generate the sampling distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{*}$

 in the same way.
 The only difference in the analysis is at the end when we calculate the
 p-value and don't consider the positive tail.

From this table we can see that of the

 Furthermore we see that the mites were applied to

 of the plants.
 Is this data indicative of mites inferring a disease resistance? More formally
 we are interested in testing 
\begin_inset Formula

H_{0}:\: & \pi_{w}=\pi_{w|m}\\
H_{0}:\: & \pi_{w}\ne\pi_{w|m}

What would you expect to see if there was absolutely no effect of the mite
 treatment? The wilting plants should be equally dispersed between the mite
 and non-mite treatments, but we also have to account for the fact that
 we have more mite treatments.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{w}=\frac{28}{47}$
\end_inset

 be the proportion all the plants that wilted, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{m}=26$
\end_inset

 be the number of plants receiving the mite treatment.
 If the treatment has no effect on wilting, then we expect 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{w}\cdot n_{m}=15.49$
\end_inset

 of the mite treated plants to wilt and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1-p_{w}\right)n_{m}=10.51$
\end_inset

 to not wilt.
 A similar calculation for the non-mite treatment shows 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{w}\cdot\left(n-n_{m}\right)=12.51$
\end_inset

 should wilt and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1-p_{w}\right)\left(n-n_{m}\right)=8.49$

 should not.

\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the row sum, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{j}$

This is the first case where our test statistic will not be just plugging
 in the sample statistic into the null hypothesis.
 Instead we will consider a test statistic that is more flexible and will
 handle more general cases (say 3 or more response or treatment groups)
 Our statistic for assessing how far our observed data is from what we expect
 under the null hypothesis involves the difference between the observed
 and the expected for each of the cells, but again we don't want to just
 sum the differences, instead will make the differences positive by squaring
 the differences.
 Second, a difference of 10 between the observed and expected cell count
 is very different if the number expected is 1000 than if it is 10, so we
 will scale the observed difference by dividing by the expected cell count.

\\
 & = & 1.92+2.37+1.30+1.61\\
\\
 & = & 7.20

If the null hypothesis is true, then this statistic should be small, and
 a large value of the statistic is indicative of the null hypothesis being
 incorrect.
 But how large must the statistic be before we reject the null hypothesis?
 Again, we'll randomly shuffle the treatment assignments and recalculate
 the statistic many times and examine the sampling distribution of

At first glance this seems wrong because it is not a nice looking distribution.
 However there are only a small number of ways to allocate the treatments
 labels to the two possible outcomes.
 Second, for the test statistic we have chosen only the right hand side
 of the distribution (large values of

performed a double-blind study and randomly divided 58 patients into two
 groups.
 The treatment group (
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}=30$
\end_inset

) received 100 mg per day of Doxycycline and the placebo group (
\begin_inset Formula $n_{p}=28$
\end_inset

) received a placebo but were unaware that it was a placebo.
 Within 5 months, the treatment group had 5 pregnancies, while the placebo
 group had 4.

\begin_layout Section
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scientific method relies on being able to decide if a given set of data
 is compatible or consistent with a particular hypothesis (which we called
 the null hypothesis).
 We answer that question by first simplifying the data to a single statistic
 that concisely measures the hypothesis of interest, and then examining
 the distribution of that statistic assuming the null hypothesis is correct.
 We called that distribution the 
\emph on
sampling distribution
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of a sample proportion, we were able to simulate the sampling
 distribution directly and all that was needed was the null hypothesis value
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 With repeated draws from the sampling distribution, we were able to infer
 how probable our observed data would be if the null hypothesis was true.
 We called that probability the 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Designed experiments are the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gold standard
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of scientific studies because the random assignment to treatment groups
 controls for unknown lurking variables.
 Due to the random assignment, each level of the lurking variables end up
 in all the treatment groups.
 This random assignment is absolutely critical in the study and our simulated
 sampling distribution is consistent with design by incorporating this randomnes
s by the shuffling of treatment labels.
 Assuming the null hypothesis of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no effect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is true, then the assignment to treatment groups is not related to the
 observed response and our simulation method respects the experimental design.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The methodology we used isn't restricted to these particular statistics.
 If we wanted to know if the median values of two treatment groups are different
, we would use 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d=\tilde{x}_{1}-\tilde{x}_{2}
\]

\end_inset

 as our sample statistic where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{x}_{1}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{x}_{2}$
\end_inset

 are the sample medians of the groups and then do usual trick of repeatedly
 calculating that same statistic on the shuffled data sets.
 The comparison of the observed statistic to the sampling distribution when
 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}$
\end_inset

 is true would remain the same.
