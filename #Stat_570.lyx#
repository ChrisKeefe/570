\begin_layout Title
Introduction to Statistics for Researchers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Derek Sonderegger
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These notes were originally written for an introductory statistics course
 for grad students in biological sciences.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with most introductory statistics courses is that they don't
 prepare the student for the use of advanced statistics.
 Rote hand calculation is easy to test, easy to grade, and easy for students
 to learn to do, but is useless for actually understanding how to apply
 statistics.
 Because students pursuing a Ph.D.
 will likely be using statistics for the rest of their professional careers,
 I feel that this sort of course should attempt to steer away from a

 undergraduate pedagogy, and give the student enough theoretical background
 to continue their statistical studies at a high level while staying away
 from the painful mathematical details that statisticians must work through.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recent pedagogical changes have been made at the undergraduate level to
 introduce sampling distributions via permutation and bootstrap procedures.
 Because those are extremely useful tools in their own right and because
 of the ability to think about statistical inference from the very start
 of the course is invaluable, I've attempted to duplicate this approach.
 I am grateful to the ICOTS 9 organizers and presenters for their expertise,
 perspective, and motivation for making such a large shift in my teaching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Statistical software has progressed by leaps and bounds over the last decades.
 Scientists need access to reliable software that is flexible enough to
 handle new problems, with minimal headaches.
 R has become a widely used, and extremely robust Open Source platform for
 statistical computing and most new methodologies will appear in R before
 being incorporated into commercial software.
 Second, data exploration is the first step of any analysis and a user friendly
 yet powerful mechanism for graphing is a critical component in a researchers
 toolbox.
 R succeeds in this area as R has the most flexible graphing library of
 any statistical software I know of and the basic plots can created quickly
 and easily.
 The only downside is that there is a substantial learning curve to learning
 a scripting language, particularly for students without any programming
 background.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the mathematical and statistical background of typical students
 varies widely, the course seems to have a split-personality disorder.
 We wish to talk about using calculus to maximize the likelihood function
 and define the expectation of a continuous random variable, but also must
 spend time defining how to calculate the a mean.
 I attempt to address both audiences, but recognize that it is not ideal.

.
 In general, I recommend printing the chapter we are currently covering
 in class.
 If you wish to submit a bug report, or submit a patch, feel free to log
 an issue on the GitHub site or to fix it and submit a pull request.
 If you wish to use these notes for your own class, feel free to do so,
 but please acknowledge the source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I encourage instructors to use these notes for their own classes and appreciate
 notification of the use to encourage me to keep tweaking the content and
 presentation.
 Finally, I hope these notes useful to a broad range of students.
